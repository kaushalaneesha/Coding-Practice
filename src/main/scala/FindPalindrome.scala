/**
  *
  * You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters denoting different types of candies. A substring of a string S is a string S'
  * that occurs in S. For example, "bam" is a substring of "babammm". Each candy costs 1 unit. You can pick some continuous candies such that you
  * can create a palindrome of length K by using some or all picked candies. Your task is to find the minimum cost to create a palindrome of length K.
  * Input Format:
  *
  * First line contains string S.
  *
  * Next line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
  *
  * Next T lines contain a single integer K.
  *
  *
  *
  * Output Format:
  *
  * For each test case, print minimum cost as mentioned above. If you cannot create a palindrome of length K then, simply print -1.
  *
  *
  *
  * Constraints:
  * Constraints:
  *
  * 1≤|S|≤10^5
  * 1≤T≤10
  * 1≤K≤10^5
  *
  *
  *
  * Sample Input
  * babammm
  * 2
  * 2
  * 5
  * Sample Output
  * 2
  * 5
  * Explanation
  * Test Case 1: You can pick candies denoted by "mm" and create a palindrome of size 2. So the cost will be 2 units.
  *
  * Test Case 2: You can pick candies denoted by "babam" and rearrange them, "bamab", to create a palindrome of size 5. So the cost will be 5 units.
